# AspectRatioChangingUsingPython
A Python script using PIL to resize images and change aspect ratios. Simple and efficient tool for image processing and resizing.

This Python script enables you to change the aspect ratio of an image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). By resizing images with the Lanczos resampling algorithm, it maintains the visual content while adjusting the aspect ratio.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install Pillow (if not already installed) using:

**pip install Pillow**

Usage

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project folder in the terminal or command prompt.
Replace "input_image_path" and "output_image_path" placeholders in the code with actual file paths.
Set the desired "new_width" and "new_height" variables for your desired aspect ratio.
Run the script using the following command:

**python aspect_ratio_changer.py**

The resized image will be saved to the specified output path.
